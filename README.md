# Contracts-Testing

A smart contract project built with Solidity and Foundry, focused on implementing and testing a fully automated raffle system using Chainlink VRF and Keepers. This repository emphasizes unit testing, fuzz testing, and mock-based verification to ensure contract reliability.

## Features

- Raffle contract using Chainlink VRF v2.5  
- Automated upkeep using Chainlink Keepers  
- Verifiable randomness for winner selection  
- Extensive Foundry tests:
  - Unit testing  
  - Event testing  
  - Revert condition checks  
  - Fuzz testing  
- Deployment and interaction scripts  
- Mock contracts for local testing

## Tech Stack

| Component  | Tool/Version       |

| Language   | Solidity ^0.8.19    |
| Framework  | Foundry (Forge/Cast)|
| Randomness | Chainlink VRF v2.5  |
| Automation | Chainlink Keepers   |
| Testing    | forge-std & mocks   |

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Foundry

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
forge install
```

### 3. Build Contracts

```
forge build
```

### 4. Run Tests

```
forge test
```

To see verbose output:

```
forge test -vvv
```

## Key Contracts

### Raffle.sol
Implements:
- Entrance fee logic  
- Randomness request via VRF  
- State transitions (OPEN → CALCULATING)  
- Event emissions  
- ETH transfers to winners

### HelperConfig.s.sol
Manages:
- Local vs Sepolia configuration  
- Mock deployment on local networks

### DeployRaffle.s.sol
Responsible for:
- Config retrieval  
- Deployment  
- Subscription setup

### Interactions.s.sol
Includes scripts to:
- Create subscriptions  
- Fund subscriptions  
- Add consumer contracts

## Testing

All tests are in `test/RaffleTest.t.sol` and cover:

- Initial state validation  
- Reverts when insufficient ETH is sent  
- Player recording  
- Event emissions  
- Rejecting entries while CALCULATING  
- `checkUpkeep` logic  
- `performUpkeep` behavior  
- Fuzz tests on VRF fulfillment

Example:

```
forge test --match-test testRaffleRevertsWhenYouDontPayEnough
```
